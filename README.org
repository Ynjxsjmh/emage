* emage.el

This package is used to enhance image insertion and yank on Emacs.

** Usage

Clone or download this repository (path of the folder is the =<path-to-emage>= used below).

In your =~/.emacs=, add the following lines:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-emage>") ; add emage to your load-path

(require 'emage)

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c i i") 'emage-insert-clipboard-image-to-point)   ;; image insert
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c i y") 'emage-yank-image-at-point-to-clipboard)  ;; image yank
#+END_SRC

Global set key is not required, you can call these two commands with =M-x=.
